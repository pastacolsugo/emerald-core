Emerald Core v2.0

Emerald is the core software upon which the Emerald Box automated greenhouse
is based.
This is version two, it's still under developement and there will be for sure
version 3.0.

The Core has been built keeping in mind modularity, maintainability and 
readability in mind.

Emerald Core is the control software that, given the user's schedule and the 
environment values (sensor readings), compute the output for the actuators.
It lacks the hardware interface, which depends on the project 
implementation.

Each control is easily "muted" during implementation by editing the 
control.hpp file.

Available controls:
	- Light1 and Light2:
		Two different and independent sets of lights, to accomodate different 
		needs.
	- Water:
		Watering line
	- Temperature:
		ON-OFF air heater and cooler. Full control on the double hysteresis 
		parameters.
	- Humidity:
		ON-OFF air humidifier and dehumidifier. Full control on the double 
		hysteresis parameters.
	- Air source:
		based on inside and outside temperature it decides whether to pick air 
		from inside or outside.

Each control features multi seasonal schedule. Based on the date of the year 
it's possible to have different season, each one with it's own schedule.
